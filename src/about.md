## Hosting

This site is deployed by, and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

Latest deploy status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ec6da587-72ba-490a-ad4b-167802a9c197/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/11st-starter-kit/deploys)

## One-click deploy

To get your own instance of this [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter project
cloned and deploying to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) very quickly, just
click the button below and follow the instructions.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/stefanfrede/11st-starter-kit)

## üëÜ Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. Netlify will clone the [git repository]({{pkg.repository.url}}) of this
   project into your GitHub account. You will be asked for the required
   permissions to add the repo for you.
2. They'll create a new site for you in Netlify, and configure it to use your
   shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing
   changes to your repo.
3. That's it really.

## üëè Kudos

I relentlessly copied this page from [Phil Hawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth) [EleventyOne](https://eleventyone.netlify.app/) starter template.
